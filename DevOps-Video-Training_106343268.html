We’ve experimented and successfully introduced some creative approaches to focus on this.

Maintaining them over time is harder. Some agilistas even claim that the cost outweighs the benefit. In this lecture, we present five principles for creating valuable, maintainable acceptance test suites. We discuss practices such as layering acceptance tests to reduce coupling between the test harness and talk about how teams should be organized in order to efficiently manage acceptance test driven development. The core of the talk discusses how to manage the evolution of acceptance tests by organizing them as scenarios rather than as suites of story tests. Finally, we show how to manage data for acceptance tests.</p><p><strong>Video: </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9ap-zH0Gkc" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9ap-zH0Gkc</a></p><div><strong>Deck:</strong> <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jezhumble/creating-maintainable-automated-acceptance-tests" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://speakerdeck.com/jezhumble/creating-maintainable-automated-acceptance-tests</a></div><h1 id="DevOpsVideoTraining-ContinuousDelivery">Continuous Delivery</h1><hr/><h2 id="DevOpsVideoTraining-ArchitectingforContinuousDelivery"><span style="font-size: 20.0px;">Architecting for Continuous Delivery</span></h2><div><p><strong>Jez Humble</strong></p><p>DevOps and Continuous Delivery represent a new paradigm for IT service delivery that promises higher quality and stability as well as faster time-to-market.Howeverdeployingthis new paradigm requires changes to both organizational culture and architecture. In this talk, Jez will present the architectural principles and patterns that enable continuous delivery at internet scale, and discuss how to incrementally evolve existing systems in order to deploy them.</p><p><strong>Video:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wnd-eyPoMo" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wnd-eyPoMo</a></p><p><strong>Deck:</strong> <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jezhumble/architecting-for-continuous-delivery" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://speakerdeck.com/jezhumble/architecting-for-continuous-delivery</a></p><h2 id="DevOpsVideoTraining-DevOpsFoundations:ContinuousDelivery">DevOps Foundations: Continuous Delivery</h2><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> James Wickett and Ernest Mueller</li><li><strong>Summary:</strong> What you need to know about continuous integration and delivery, with demos in Jenkins, Nexus, and more.</li><li><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.lynda.com/IT-Infrastructure-tutorials/DevOps-Foundations-Continuous-DeliveryContinuous-Integration/606079-2.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.lynda.com/IT-Infrastructure-tutorials/DevOps-Foundations-Continuous-DeliveryContinuous-Integration/606079-2.html</a></li></ul><h1 id="DevOpsVideoTraining-DevOpsFundamentals">DevOps Fundamentals</h1><hr/><h2 id="DevOpsVideoTraining-DevOpsFoundations:ContinuousDelivery.1">DevOps Foundations: Continuous Delivery</h2></div><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> James Wickett and Ernest Mueller</li><li><strong>Summary:</strong> What you need to know about continuous integration and delivery, with demos in jenkins, nexus, and more.</li><li><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Operating-Systems-tutorials/DevOps-Fundamentals/508618-2.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.lynda.com/Operating-Systems-tutorials/DevOps-Fundamentals/508618-2.html</a></li></ul><h2 id="DevOpsVideoTraining-DevOpsFoundations:InfrastructureAutomation">DevOps Foundations: Infrastructure Automation</h2><ul><li><strong>Authors:</strong> James Wickett and Ernest Mueller</li><li><strong>Summary:</strong> Two hours of infrastructure automation concepts, with demos illustrating them in everything from Cloudformation to chef</li><li><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.lynda.com/IT-Infrastructure-tutorials/DevOps-Foundations-Infrastructure-Automation/574705-2.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.lynda.com/IT-Infrastructure-tutorials/DevOps-Foundations-Infrastructure-Automation/574705-2.html</a></li></ul><p> </p><div><h1 id="DevOpsVideoTraining-Lynda.com/LinkedInLearning"><a href="http://linda.com/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Lynda.com</a><span> / LinkedIn Learning</span></h1><hr/><p><a href="http://lynda.com/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Lynda.com</a> access is free if you have a Plano Library Card.
