Instead, minimize total cost.</li><li>Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service to improve quality and productivity and thus constantly decrease costs.</li><li>Institute training on the job.</li><li>Institute leadership. The aim of supervision should be to help people and machines and gadgets to do a better job.</li><li>Drive out fear so that everyone may work effectively for the company.</li><li>Break down barriers between departments. People in research, design, sales, and production must work as a team to foresee problems of production and use of the product or service.</li><li>Eliminate asking for zero defects and new levels of productivity. Such exhortations only create adversarial relationships as the bulk of the causes of low quality and low productivity belong to the system and thus lie beyond the power of the workforce.</li><li>Remove barriers that rob the hourly worker of his right to pride of workmanship.</li><li>Remove barriers that rob people in management and in engineering of their right to pride of workmanship.</li><li>Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement.</li><li>Put everybody in the company to work to accomplish the transformation. The transformation is everybody's job.</li></ul><p>Source: <a href="https://searcherp.techtarget.com/definition/kaizen-or-continuous-improvement" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://searcherp.techtarget.com/definition/kaizen-or-continuous-improvement</a></p><p> </p><p> </p>
