The Scrum Guide is based on the principles on which Scrum was founded. It offers Scrum practitioners worldwide, a common standard and understanding of the foundations of Scrum. This collaboration adds real value and can only benefit everyone practicing, or considering practicing Scrum. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><br/></span></p><p class="p1"><strong>Definition</strong> </p><p>Scrum (n): A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.</p><p>Scrum is:</p><ul><li>Lightweight</li><li>Simple to understand</li><li>Difficult to master</li></ul><p>Scrum is a process framework that has been used to manage work on complex products since the early 1990s. Scrum is not a process, technique, or definitive method. Rather, it is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques. Scrum makes clear the relative efficacy of your product management and work techniques so that you can continuously improve the product, the team, and the working environment.</p><p>The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules. Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to Scrum’s success and usage.</p><p>The rules of Scrum bind together the roles, events, and artifacts, governing the relationships and interaction between them. The rules of Scrum are described throughout the body of this document. Specific tactics for using the Scrum framework vary and are described elsewhere.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why Scrum for Connected Technologies </strong></p><p>Scrum was initially developed for managing and developing products. Starting in the early 1990s, Scrum has been used extensively, worldwide, to:</p><ol><li>Research and identify viable markets, technologies, and product capabilities;</li><li>Develop products and enhancements;</li><li>Release products and enhancements, as frequently as many times per day;</li><li>Develop and sustain Cloud (online, secure, on-demand) and other operational environments for product use; and,</li><li>Sustain and renew products.</li></ol><p>Scrum has been used to develop software, hardware, embedded software, networks of interacting function, autonomous vehicles, schools, government, marketing, managing the operation of organizations and almost everything we use in our daily lives, as individuals and societies.</p><h3 id="ConnectedSamurai-Scrum-Transparency">Transparency</h3><p>Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome. Transparency requires those aspects be defined by a common standard so observers share a common understanding of what is being seen.</p><p>For example</p><ul><li>A common language referring to the process must be shared by all participants; and,</li><li>Those performing the work and those inspecting the resulting increment must share a common definition of “Done”.</li></ul><h3 id="ConnectedSamurai-Scrum-Inspection">Inspection</h3><p>Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances. Their inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way of the work. Inspections are most beneficial when diligently performed by skilled inspectors at the point of work.</p><h3 id="ConnectedSamurai-Scrum-Adaptation">Adaptation</h3><p>If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being processed must be adjusted. An adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.</p><p>Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation, as described in the Scrum Events section of this document:</p><ul><li>Sprint Planning</li><li>Daily Scrum</li><li>Sprint Review</li><li>Sprint Retrospective<br/><br/></li></ul><p><strong>Scrum Roles</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(9,30,66);">Product owners are the champions for their product. They are focused on understanding business and market requirements, then prioritizing the work to be done by the engineering team accordingly.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(9,30,66);"><span style="color: rgb(9,30,66);">Scrum masters are the champion for scrum within their team. They coach the team, the product owner, and the business on the scrum process and look for ways to fine-tune their practice of it. An effective scrum master deeply understands the work being done by the team and can help the team optimize their delivery flow.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(9,30,66);"><span style="color: rgb(9,30,66);">Scrum teams are the champions for sustainable development practices. The most effective scrum teams are tight-knit, co-located, and usually 5 to 7 members. Team members have differing skill sets, and cross-train each other so no one person becomes a bottleneck in the delivery of work. All members of the team help one another to ensure a successful sprint completion.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(9,30,66);"><span style="color: rgb(9,30,66);"><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(9,30,66);"><span style="color: rgb(9,30,66);">Our Way of Life - The Scrum Way</span></span></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(9,30,66);"><span style="color: rgb(9,30,66);"><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/107086114/107086129.png" data-image-src="attachments/107086114/107086129.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="107086129" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2018-5-7 9:0:37.png" data-base-url="https://confluence.sdlc.toyota.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="107086114" data-linked-resource-container-version="2"></span></span></span></p>
